    "welcomeText": "Welcome to Fork around the world my food baby from eating my way through London! What started as a basic millennials instagram page slowly turned into my personal recipe log during Covid. However being a front-end developer, with too much time on my hands and no hobby other then eating good food, I thought I might as-well build a site that made my recipes easy to search.\n\nMy recipes are vegetarian and suited for the fast paced, gym filled (#Gains) life that London offers. So hopefully you enjoy exploring them; You can click on the menu in the top left hand corner to see the different categories or just search for your favourite ingredient. Each recipe can be easily shared and comes with checklist of the ingredients since we don't have all the time in the world to aimlessly walk through Tesco anymore.\n\nDrop me a follow on Instagram for the latest on my eating adventures and restaurant recommendations! Happy eating!"

      "title": "Maple-glazed parsnip, chestnut & feta roast",
      "method": "Heat the oven to 190Â°C/170Â°C fan/ gas 5. Lightly butter a deep 20cm loose-bottomed cake tin and line the base with baking paper. Steam the parsnips for 5-8 minutes to take off the raw edge (they donâ€™t need to be cooked all the way through). Put in a colander and leave to dry.\n\nSpread the pecans and almonds in an even layer on a baking sheet, then toast for 5 minutes in the oven. Add the pine nuts and toast for 3-5 minutes more until golden. Cool, roughly chop and set aside.\n\nMelt 75g butter in a large frying pan on a low heat. Add the leeks, season and cook gently, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes until soft and sweet, then transfer to a large mixing bowl.\n\nAdd the remaining 75g butter to the frying pan and turn up the heat to high. When the butter is hot and foaming, add the mushrooms, season with salt and pepper, then cook for 5-7 minutes, tossing every now and then, until golden brown. Add the chestnuts and garlic, then cook for 2 minutes, stirring so the garlic doesnâ€™t brown. Add the mixture to the leeks, along with the chopped nuts, chopped herbs, breadcrumbs and flour. Taste and season.\n\nWipe out the frying pan and put it over a medium-high heat. Add the maple syrup and a knob of butter. When bubbling, add the parsnip pieces, without crowding the pan. Fry for 3-4 minutes until golden, then flip over and cook for another couple of minutes on the other side. Remove with a fish slice, leaving the syrup in the pan, and put the parsnips, flat-side down and spaced out a little, into the cake tin. Leave the buttery maple syrup in the pan.\n\nCrumble the feta into the nut mixture, then crack in the eggs and mix well to combine. Spoon the mixture on top of the parsnips and press down lightly. Bake in a 190Â°C/170Â°C fan/gas 5 oven for 45 minutes, covering the top with foil if it browns too much (a little colour is good). Let it cool in the tin for 10-15 minutes, then invert carefully onto a flat plate and peel off the baking paper.\n\nReheat the syrup in the pan, season with sea salt and add a few rosemary sprigs. Brush the caramel over the top of the loaf, decorate with the rosemary leaves and serve with a sharply dressed bitter salad.",

Usually a fridge cleaner made from leftover rice and vegetables this was a staple in my house on rainy days. This dish is usually served with yoghurt (or a yoghurt gravy called Khadi) alternatively they can be steamed and then pan fried in sesame seeds. My take is much easier with the same comfroting taste reminiscent of a rainy day in Kenya. Perfect with a cup of chai!",
